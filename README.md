Before initalizating project be shure that you have node v14.18.2 and npm 6.14.15

For simplifying deployment I add script that will create mnemonic on ./keys folder and you just need fauced accound to some funds. I prefer to use https://faucet.ropsten.be.
For creat mnemonic just run npm run "npm run gen:ropsten-key".
